This code is intended to send all input from a client machine to a server machine, which will send this input to its own subshell
through a TCP connection. The subshell output will be sent back to the client via the same TCP socket, which the client will then 
output to the screen. Code can be shutdown from server side using ^D.

lab1b-server.c usage: ./lab1b-server [--port=PORTNUM] [--shell=PROGRAM] [--compress]
	       -port opens that port, used to establish a TCP socket which client can connect to
	       -shell designates which program will be run in child forked from server. Under standard usage,
	       program should be /bin/bash to execute a subshell
	       -compress is used for optional compression of output sent back to the client using the zlib compression 
	       libraries (note that compression must be unpacked from the client and, thus, for compressed communication,
	       both client and server should pass --compress)

lab1b-client.c usage: ./lab1b-client [--port=PORTNUM] [--compress] [--log=FILENAME]
	       -port designates the port onto which the client will attempt to make a TCP connection to
	       -compress is used for optional compression input sent to the server using the zlib compression 
	       libraries (note that compression must be unpacked from the server and, thus, for compressed communication,
	       both client and server should pass --compress)
	       -log is used for designating a file onto which all communication (sent and received bytes) will be
	       recorded

Also includes a Makefile which can build two executables, lab1b-client and lab1b-server, using the default make target. Also has a clean
target which will remove the executables.
